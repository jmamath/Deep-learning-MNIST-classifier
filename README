Introduction

The MNIST dataset has been used for a
while in computer vision, it consist of
hand written digits. more infos on ...
In this project, we are going to build a fully connected neural network with
tensorflow (a python package for deep learning) to learn how to recognise
those digits.

Background

We will use Python and several libraries such as numpy, tensorflow,
A general knowledge of machine learning is expected, and more specifically
deep learning techniques will be used. some are forward propagation
backward propagation, regularization.
For general infos there's lots of good resources. I've personally learnt
all of the general concepts as well as the programming techniques
in Coursera  : ----
               ----
But for general infos you can use Wikipedia, there's also easy to go

Goal

Our goal is to have 97.9 % accuracy. It is possible to reach 99.9% using
convolutional neural network. It will be our next goal.

The code

There is three files in this project
.Model contains the actual model that we use to train our model
.Utils is composed of all the relevant functions needed for Model to
works well.
.Load_dataset is the code use to get our data in a relevant format.
.Tests contains units test for each functions of utils
