## Introduction

When you post a letter you usually write the post code manually. 
There is learning algorithms that are able to automatically "read" your written digits.
Our goal is to train such a model using a fully connected neural network and get 98 % accuracy. 
I guess it is possible to reach 99.9% using convolutional neural network, but I haven't learnt it yet.

The MNIST dataset has been used for a while in computer vision, it consist of
hand written digits. More informations
can be found on http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist

In this project, we are going to use tensorflow (a python package for deep learning).

## Data

* train_x is my training set of 50000 hand written digits
* train_y is my label set of 50000 numerical digits corresponding to train_x

* test_x is the test set of features 10000 hand written digits
* test_y is the test set of labels 10000 of digits


## Background

We will use Python and several libraries such as numpy, tensorflow,
A general knowledge of machine learning is expected, and more specifically
deep learning techniques will be used. some are forward propagation
backward propagation, regularization ...

For general informations there's lots of good resources on the web. I've personally learnt
all of the general concepts as well as the programming techniques from Pr Andrew Ng
on Coursera  : https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning
               https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning 
Otherwise their is a really exciting video from Siraj Raval

## The code

There is three files in this project
* plk_to_h5.py unizip and transform the data to hdf5 format
* Load_data_v.py is the code use to get our data in a relevant format for machine learning
* model_utils.py is composed of all the relevant functions needed for Model to
works well.
* Test.py contains units test for each functions of utils
* model.py contains the actual model that we use to train our model
